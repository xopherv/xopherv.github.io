                        The Royal Canadian Mint is a Crown corporation that produces all of Canada's circulation coins. It also manufactures circulation coins on behalf of other nations. The Mint also designs and manufactures precious and base metal collector coins, gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion coins, medals, and medallions. The Mint operates facilities in Ottawa, Winnipeg, and a sales office in Vancouver. The Mint is a for-profit organization and pays dividends to the Crown.

                    <p>
                        I was a part of the IT department at the Royal Canadian Mint. I was assigned to the IT Service Desk team and was responsible for providing technical support to the employees of the Mint. I was also responsible for the maintenance of the IT equipment and the inventory of the IT department. I was also assigned to a project that involved the implementation of a new software that would be used by the employees of the Mint. I was responsible for the testing of the software and the creation of the training material for the employees.

                        My first year attending RRC in the BIT program has showed me that I have come a long way since my first year in post-secondary. When I was in U1 at the University of Manitoba, I hardly interacted with my instructors. I was so intimidated by the large classroom setting that I did not bother to reach out to my instructor when I needed help. Fast-forward to today and I have shown that I am comfortable speaking to my instructors on a 1-on-1 basis and in a classroom setting. The instructors at RRC make sure to let me know when they are available and it is very easy to approach them. I am confident that going forward I can look to them for help if I am struggling to understand new concepts.

                        The Inspire Conference was an experience where I gained so much knowledge about what people in the IT field do and how the industry works. It was an event that took up the entire day and it was constantly providing me with new knowledge that I can use going forward in my future career. The networking lounge was where I was able to shine. The networking lounge gave me the opportunity to ask people from various companies any questions I had about their job. It was a place where I was able to showcase my communication and networking skills and I was even asked by a manager at Shared Services Canada to email my resume to him. I learned a lot about companies that I have been interested in working for and am looking forward to getting into the application process for these companies.

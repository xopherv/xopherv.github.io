                    <p>
                        The experience of in-person learning after not being able to be physically present in classes for so long was quite valuable as it is my first item of significant learning. It took a little bit of getting used to the social aspects of being in a physical classroom again. I had to dedicate myself to waking up earlier and bringing myself to school every morning as it was a big commitment to leave the comfort of my home. I also cannot stress how networking early in the term impacted my success in understanding what was being taught in classes. I was able to bounce ideas off of my peers again and have discussions to further our understanding of the new concepts.

                    <p>
                        This year's Directions Conference was the first I had attended of its kind. It was held at the RBC Convention Centre and was a great opportunity to network with industry professionals and other students. I was able to learn about the different companies that were present at the conference and what they were looking for in potential employees. I was also able to learn about the different career paths that I could take with my degree. It was surreal being at an event so large that consisted of like-minded individuals wanting to expand their network. I learned so many things like what it means to be sustainable in the industry as one of the panels educated me on the subject. The professionals at the round tables and fireside chats provided an entirely new perspective on the tech industry and what I need to be mindful of going forward in my career.

                        Industry Perspectives Project Interview...
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The Industry Perspectives Project was a very valuable experience as my group was able to interview the CEO of Delphi Technology Corp, Alan Tay. Alan provided us with insight several things about his experience as the top dog of his company. The most important piece of knowledge I gained was the importance of wanting to learn and be a sponge as a new hire at any workplace. He stated that he looks for hard-working and driven individuals when he recruits interns and provided some advice for students who are not sure where they want to be yet. From Alan I learned that the only way to know if you do not like something in the industry is to experience it.

                        Co-op Interviews...
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        My experience with the co-op interviews was also significant as one of my learning items. Alan Tay's advice came into play directly while I was interviewing for co-op since I wanted to show the employers that I was willing to absorb as much knowledge as I can while working in the field. I was terribly nervous every time I was waiting for the time of the interview, and the nervousness did not disappear when the interviews started. The interviewee really plays a big factor in how comfortable you feel while you are speaking as I noticed differences between employers and how they were conducting the interview. I do feel like I made the most out of those experiences and sold myself really well and I was proven right when I passed both the interviews! Going forward, I will have to tell myself to be more confident and hopefully it will relieve my anxious feelings during future interviews.

                        The Web Development project is another learning item I enjoyed quite a lot. In this project, we are instructed to come up with an idea for a website. The creative freedom mixed with how well structured the project rubric was played a big factor in how much I enjoyed this project. I was able to apply my HTML knowledge and utilize my newly gained knowledge of PHP, AJAX, Cookies and Sessions to construct a project that I am very proud of. It amazes me to think that I was able to make something like this project website with so many features that we see in modern websites today. I will definitely want to be doing more of this sort of project in the future.

                    <p>
                        The Programming assignments have been a pleasant learning item and experience for me this term as well. The assignments build upon one another to construct a system that mimics an online banking program. I enjoyed this because I am very interested in the financial field as well as computers, and it was a cool merge between the two areas. I was able to create code for assignments that allowed a user to use the program to make deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and other banking tasks while utilizing programming concepts and patterns I had learned in the past.

                        The database project was also quite fun as this learning item allowed me to create a database out of data from one of my favorite video games. In this project, I had to design a database that had many relationships, tables, and database features that you might see in a modern database backend. Setting up stored procedures, functions, indexes and more to organize the information in the database was a lengthy process that felt rewarding to complete.

                    <p>
                        My last learning item is the LinkedIn Learning that I did as WIL prep. For this assignment, I chose to watch two courses about improving focus and time management. These are two concepts I often struggle with so they were courses that immediately piqued my interest when I saw them on LinkedIn Learning. I learned that I could improve focus by actively setting up a work environment that minimizes distractions and maximizes productivity. My favorite technique was placing an object that reminds you of why you are doing your job on or around your workspace.
